Vim Tutorial

1. Before pressing any keys, take a look around vim! (If you pressed a key
simply hit ESC on your keyboard to resume command mode.)

#NOTE: Do not press any keys until instructed.

2. Vim has two commonly used modes:
        a. Command
        b. Insert

3. Command is used to give the Vim editor commands, such as:
        #Command Argument       #Action
        $ w                     Write/Save
        $ q                     Quit
        $ syntax on|off         Turn on programming syntax
        $ i                     Insert Mode
